# Condo Price Prediction in Chiang Mai

This project aims to predict condo prices in Chiang Mai using machine learning models. By analyzing various factors such as location, size, and amenities, the model predicts the price of condos in the area. The project was developed in collaboration with senior students at Chiang Mai University as part of their capstone project.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Preprocessing and exploration of condo pricing data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented various regression models for price prediction, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Key Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort involving senior students at Chiang Mai University, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem. The students were actively involved in every phase of the project, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection and performance evaluation.
